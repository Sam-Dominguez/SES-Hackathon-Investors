## Description
![Landing page](images/landingPage.png)
Sometimes the only thing preventing a million-dollar idea from coming to life is a lack of funding. Our web application, LaunchPad, aims to mitigate that issue by providing a simple and intuitive platform to connect investors with startups and entrepreneurs. LaunchPad offers an easy way to sign up and post your startup for investors to see. Investors can quickly search for startups based on a variety of filters and entrepreneurs can search for investors in the same way. Have a startup but also want to invest? No problem! With one account users have full access to both dashboards.

## Features
- Simple sign up process or login with a Google account
- Get recommendations of investors to contact and startups to explore!
- Filter out investors and startups by name, location, or tags
- Post about your own startup opportunity and catch the attention of potential investors
